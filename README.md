# Lessons from having a complex vim config: don't do it

It's a time sink.

Having the vim configuration break all the time, and pasting in "nice to have" stuff has caused me
more disruption / harm than it has benefitted me. I'm trying to turn my VIM into a lean editing
system, and just learning plain-old VIM more effectively.

If you want to go back to where I used to be to look feel free to see:

I'm hoping to have a happier, healthier VIM experience, life, etc. with a simple vim config.
